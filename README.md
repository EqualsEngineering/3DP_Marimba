# 3DP_Marimba
Code for the 3DP marimba

This is the code for the the bar tuning of the 3DP marimba.
If you have printed the original set of 13 keys and they are out of tune, insert the length of the bars in "x_length" and what frequency they have in "y_frequency".
Run the code and then you will receive an approximate function which you can use to get appripriate lengths for your bars.
